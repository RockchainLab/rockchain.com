				<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">What is tokenization when applied to assets and securities?</h6>
				<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
					<p>The tokenization of a security or asset, is a process to allow potentially faster, cheaper and more programmable formats of the underlying asset or instrument to be transferable between eligible parties within a ‘digital wrapper’. This could be a right to money, property or represent a physical asset like a building, art or jewelry. In an equity context, tokens can represent shares in a business.  Security tokens may be programmable representations of financial instruments and can imitate the economic behavior of the underlying asset. They can also represent other forms of fractional ownership or rights to money arising from revenue or the sale of the asset. The tokens are fungible, and tradeable subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		<div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Why Tokenize?</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
                <!-- <p>The benefits will vary between different use-cases (debt, equity, fractional ownership of assets etc.) and will evolve over time. However benefits cited include broader and cheaper access to larger global pools of capital for issuers -  lower fees, faster deal execution, enhanced international market exposure, accessing a larger potential investor base, enabling automated service functions and a reduced role for middlemen and a reduction in the potential for financial institution manipulation. It is also a potentially more ‘programmable’ form of ownership and over time we expect to see enhancements to existing instruments and investment models as well as innovation in what is offered to investors, in tokenized form.</p> -->
								<p>Representing something with a token makes it easier to track ownership.</p>
								<p>Benefits include:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Transparency</strong>
									<p>Each token has a unique identifier and owner, which can be logged in a register which stores that investor information and all relevant transactions on the blockchain in a secure, tamper-proof manner.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Accuracy and Security</strong>
									<p>Information is updated in real-time and immutably in a reliable and accessible way where the responsibility for the accuracy of information doesn’t rest with one party.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Efficiency and cost-effectiveness</strong>
									<p>Faster, easier transfer of beneficial ownership, removing transactional friction. With fewer third party processes required, transaction fees and timelines are reduced.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Fractionalization</strong>
									<p>While fractionalisation isn’t new as such, tokens do allow greater direct access by more investors to specific assets (e.g. a building) that was not previously possible outside an intermediary or costly and inflexible corporate structures.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Opportunity for higher value investor relations</strong>
									<p>With data collected effectively and securely, you can be more informed to build higher value and more targeted investor communications.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Easier to leverage the equity</strong>
									<p>Able to lend more easily against equity e.g. tokens transferred to lender or held in escrow pending repayment of loan.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Access to more potential liquidity</strong>
									<p>Open Exchanges: Access to new liquidity/markets as the regulated security token exchanges come on-line in 2019; Closed Exchanges: Opportunity to create internally managed exchange/transfers.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Programmability</strong>
									<p>Ability to add features to the token e.g. hold >X tokens to qualify for benefits/access rights (can tie it to a loyalty scheme) or a tenured voting programme i.e. the longer you hold the tokens, the more votes you get.</p>
								</li>

			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">It’s still has to appeal as an Investment</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
				<p>Tokenization or ‘doing’ an STO does not turn an ugly duckling into a swan. Put another way, ‘tokenization’ in and of itself does not turn create substantial new value where none existed before.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Coordinated advice and services are needed</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
				<p>Undertaking an STO without legal, technology and investment advisors who are coordinated in the delivery of the process is unlikely to succeed. In short:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li style="margin: 0 0 6px 25px;">The asset and the terms on which the investment opportunity is offered, should first be attractive to the target eligible investors.</li>
                    <li style="margin: 0 0 6px 25px;">The issuer and its advisers must be confident that the rights it offers can be delivered and that the issue is in line with its business strategy.</li>
                    <li style="margin: 0 0 6px 25px;">Tokenizing debt, equity, or the sorts of rights normally associated with shares in a company or fund are regulated activities. Existing securities laws and those relating to collective investment schemes, alternative investment funds and more, may apply. Issuers must invest early in appropriate legal advice  - in the jurisdiction of the issuing entity and from the perspective of where the offer is being promoted and for the types of investor targeted - accredited, institutional, retail and with respect to any exempt offerings or other routes to a legally compliant offering.</li>
                    <li style="margin: 0 0 6px 25px;">The technology and processes must then enshrine and facilitate consistently the rights, restrictions and parameters that apply to the underlying asset.</li>
                    <li style="margin: 0 0 6px 25px;">The processes associated with maintaining the digital asset, associated documentation and enabling transferability (peer-to-peer, OTC or Exchange) must be supported and managed.</li>

		<h2 class="heading-2">Examples</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Equity Token:</strong> Tokens that represent an equity position in an underlying asset. E.g. Tokenize the equity in your private company (pre-IPO growth) for existing shareholders and new shareholders as they buy in. Expand the liquidity for selling shareholders (Tokenization of illiquid assets may increase their market value). Open the investment space to additional classes of investors, with low entrance thresholds.</li>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Debt Token:</strong> Tokens that represent private debt to create broader and cheaper access to global pools of capital and for investors to access middle market investment opportunities. E.g. An established business wants to raise capital as a bond to fund expansion or development.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Examples of enhancement concepts and additional programmability:</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Where relevant, such an offering could be aimed at a brand’s existing and loyal customer-base to create a loyalty bonding curve between customers who already love the product/service and who want to benefit from its ongoing economic success and will do more to encourage that success as super-affiliates when they also the tokens e.g. hospitality, brands.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Enhanced Rights could be offered for token-holders at different levels e.g. all token-holders get benefits (discount on purchases, priority upgrade/access/reservation, partner products etc.) and if you hold more than X tokens you get super-benefits (which might include a higher return - coupon rate or share of dividends).</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Property fractional ownership:</strong> Sell a building that has been or will be converted into apartments on a managed basis for fractional ownership with a modest minimum buy in enabling more people to participate in an asset that would not traditionally be available to them. <p>&nbsp;</p></li>
			<li><strong>Employee incentives/rewards:</strong>These can be traded prior to an IPO or other liquidity event to create a new market when companies are staying private longer. E.g. Staff member A is awarded and vests tokens representing an equity interest and might want to sell these prior to a liquidity event to staff member B or, if permitted and where there is demand someone outside the organisation, at a discount to value to realise value now versus when the share value crystallises on a liquidity event.<p>&nbsp;</p></li>
			<li><strong>Inheritance:</strong>Siblings inherit a high value piece of art that they don’t want to sell as it is an appreciating asset, but some of them want to release some of its value via a token sale and create ongoing transferability opportunities.<p>&nbsp;</p></li>
