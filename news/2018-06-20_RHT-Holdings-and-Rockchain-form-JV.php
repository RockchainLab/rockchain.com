			<h1>RHT Holdings and Rockchain.com announce joint venture in Singapore</h1>
			<p class="blog-article__date">Published on June 20th, 2018</p>

			<p>Asia’s leading professional services group, RHT Holdings and Gibraltar- based consulting, software development and crypto fund management company, Rockchain.com, today announced the establishment of a joint venture to support businesses and investors tapping into increasing opportunities within the crypto economy.</p>
      <p>Drawing on the combined expertise of RHT Holdings and Rockchain, the new Singapore based joint venture company, RHT Rockchain Advisory Pte Ltd (“RHTRA”), will be an integrated crypto solutions provider, with a firm focus on transparency, integrity and projects with a sound token-to-market strategy.</p>
      <p>RHTRA will deliver blockchain, business consultancy and project management for token generating events (TGEs) amidst the region’s growing interest and investments in the crypto economy.</p>
      <p>In addition, RHTRA will support its clients in technology, marketing and other ancillary services for TGEs and for businesses applying blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies in general. RHTRA will also deliver specialised tokenomics consultancy and advice on exchange listings.</p>
			<p class="blog-article__quote">We are very excited with the establishment of RHTRA through our partnership with Rockchain. We believe that through our combined expertise, RHTRA will deliver great value and forge ahead as a leading integrated solutions provider in Singapore and Asia’s crypto economy space.</p>
			<p class="blog-article__quote-author"><span>Jayaprakash Jagateesan</span>, Chief Executive Officer of RHT Holdings.</p>
      <p class="blog-article__quote">The partnership presents a win-win opportunity where RHTRA will be built on the combined expertise of RHT Holdings’ compliance, technology and marketing expertise as well as Rockchain’s deep understanding of the Blockchain ecosystem and their technical experience in the Token economy, Distributed Ledger Technology and Digital Asset Management,</p>
      <p class="blog-article__quote-author">he added.</p>
      <p>RHT Holdings will bring its experience and understanding of Singapore and Asia’s compliance landscape, managing risks and addressing key concerns such as anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). This will further differentiate RHTRA as a trusted advisory services provider in the crypto economy space.</p>
			<p class="blog-article__quote">We believe investors will be more willing to pay a premium for professionally advised ICOs. RHTRA’s knowledge of global best practices and the nuances of working in Asia will further contribute to the success of our clients’ TGEs.</p>
			<p class="blog-article__quote-author"><span>Nizam Ismail</span>, Co-Founder of RHT Compliance Solutions.</p>
			<p class="blog-article__quote">Our collaboration with RHT Holdings reflects our continued commitment to partnering with best-in-class service providers to deliver the right solutions for our clients. With this move, RHTRA will be able to deliver world-class DLT and crypto advisory services, backed by experienced local compliance industry professionals for added transparency and integrity.</p>
			<p class="blog-article__quote-author"><span>Julian Jarvis</span>, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Rockchain.</p>
			<p class="blog-article__quote">While the opportunities for businesses and investors in the crypto economy are exciting and capable of creating significant value, there needs to be a sensible level of regulation and due diligence for the sustainable development of this sector. Through RHTRA, we are proud to be a part of the industry’s growth in Singapore and Asia which we see as having great synergies with the regulatory leadership we have seen at home in Gibraltar,</p>
