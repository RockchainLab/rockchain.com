    <h2>How do we develop Utility Token Smart contracts?</h2>
		<div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Technical specification</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
				<p>The ERC20/ERC721 specify the minimum functionality that an Ethereum smart contract needs to provide to users in order to be considered compatible with the respective tokens. As long as that minimum is provided, an arbitrary number of additional features can be included in the contract without breaking compatibility.</p>
				<p>We work with you closely to understand your needs and prepare a Technical Specification document, describing the attributes of your Token and any additional features you select, while ensuring compatibility with the selected standard.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Token Development</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
				<p>We develop the smart contract in the Solidity programming language, following industry best coding practices, using robust and production tested frameworks and libraries. We will make the resulting code available to you in your private <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> repository. You may chose to make the repository public, and allow your community to independently verify contract compliance with your other project documentation.
</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Token Testing</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
        <h3>Unit Tests</h3>
				<p>We test the token smart contract off-chain first, using industry standard tools and local Ethereum blockchain. We perform Unit Tests for each function in the Smart Contract separately. Unit tests are actions that focus on a specific unit of code, usually a function, and stress it by trying out different inputs, both normal and abnormal, checking that the outputs are as expected.</p>
        <h3>Integration Tests</h3>
        <p>We then run Integration Tests for the contract as a whole. Integration tests involve multiple pieces of the code, usually functions, being run in concert in order to simulate a process flow and verify that the different parts work together as specified.</p>
        <h3>Testnet deployment</h3>
        <p>Lastly, we deploy the contract to one of the Ethereum test networks (e.g. Ropsten) and run the tests again in a distributed environment.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Token Audit</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
        <h3>Audit preparation</h3>
				<p>An audit should be conducted prior deployment on the main net (e.g. Ethereum) by a reputable, independent third party. We’ll work closely with your Code Auditor, to ensure a smooth and seamless auditing processes.</p>
        <h3>Audit feedback implementation</h3>
        <p>We’ll carefully analyse and process feedback received from your auditor and implement it into the code.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Mainnet Deployment</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
				<p>We will compile and deploy the Token Smart Contract to the Ethereum mainnet. From now on the public can start interacting with your Token.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Post Deployment Administration</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
				<p>While Rockchain remains in control of the administrative functions of the smart contract immediately after the deployment, we can perform administrative actions as per your request.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
    <div class="question-wrapper">
			<h6 class="question-wrapper__question">Transfer of Ownership</h6>
			<div class="question-wrapper__answer">
				<p>The Owner of the contract will be changed from the deployer (Rockchain) to your designated Ethereum address.</p>
