				<p class="paragraph-1"><strong>Information and Communication Technology Security policies are a common requirement today for anyone involved in regulated industries, such as online gambling, financial services, digital/crypto asset management companies or any business that processes customer data.</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph-1">If you operate a website, app, ecommerce store, software as a service products, deal with digital assets or consumer data in any way, you will need a range of policies to manage your business risk and comply with your regulatory and governance requirements. Prevention is better than cure and if you are caught unprepared, you risk damages and fines. Creating custom policies from scratch can be time-consuming and technically difficult.</p>
